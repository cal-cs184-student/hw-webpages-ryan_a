		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>A bezier curve consists of a list of control points, and when given a t from 0 to 1 the bezier curve will return a point that is a linear combination of all the control points. After evaluating for all t, you will have a curve that smoothly passes near the given control points.</p>
		<p>De Casteljau’s algorithm for evaluating bezier curves is a recursive algorithm that at each step computes the linear interpolation of each control point and the control point following it, based on the given t. This means that each step reduces the number of points by one, until we are left with just a single point which is the evaluated point.</p>
		<p>My implementation does this by, looping through the given array of points, and returning a new array that is one shorter, containing all the new linearly interpolated points based on t. The results after each step of subdivision are shown below, along with the fully evaluated curve (i.e. after evaluating for all t).</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		
		<p>As an aside, this recursive algorithm is not very efficient, especially considering I am making a new array for each step. A faster implementation would expand the linear interpolation equations to get an analytical solution for the final point in terms of the original control points. The equation for three points is shown below, and a general solution for any number of points can be found using the binomial theorem (Pascal’s triangle).</p>
		<p>\[ (1-t)^2 * p_0 + 2(1-t)t * p_1 + t^2 * p_2 \]</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>Bezier curves can be extended into bezier surfaces, which contain a 2D grid of n x n control points, which can also be thought of as n bezier curves, each with n points. When given two coordinates (u, v) to evaluate at, we can first evaluate the n bezier curves lying in the “u axis”, using the u coordinate to perform the 1D evaluation as before. Then, we are left with n evaluated points, which we can evaluate in the “v axis” using the given v coordinate to get our final evaluated point.</p>
		<p>My implementation does this by evaluating the n bezier curves in the “u axis” and placing their results into an array of points. I then use this list of points as a bezier curve, and evaluate it using the given v coordinate. I also had to write a helper function that fully evaluates a 1D bezier curve, which just repeatedly calls a function identical to the one from part 1 until it returns an array of length one. My results are shown below:</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>In the pictures above, there are visible triangles left over after shading. This problem comes from how the surface normals used in shading are constant inside each triangle, making every pixel in a triangle have the same shading. Instead, what we can do is assign each vertex a normal vector. Then, through barycentric coordinates, this normal vector will be smoothly blended for each pixel, resulting in a smooth surface.</p>
		<p>In order to calculate the normal vector for each vertex, my implementation uses the halfedge data structures to traverse around each neighboring triangle, and uses the cross product of two vectors on the triangle to calculate that triangle’s normal vector scaled by its area. Then, I sum these area-weighted normals, and then normalize the result and return it as that vertex’s normal. A comparison with and without smooth shading is shown below:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <img src="s2p2_diagram.png" height="300px"/>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>My implementation rotates the edge clockwise, along with the faces. My first step is gathering references to all the halfedge data structures that I needed (HalfedgeIters, VertexIters, FaceIters). I then fix the faces and vertices by updating their halfedge to one of the ones they should now be touching. I don’t have to update any edge data structures as they all should still be pointing to the same halfedge. I then fix the half edges by updating their vertex, face, and next pointers where necessary. The only bug I encountered was forgetting to update the vertices’ half edge pointers. The results of edge flipping on the teapot are shown below:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <figcaption>Many edge flips</figcaption>

			  </tr>

		</div>
		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="s2p3_diagram.png" height="300px"/>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>Unlike edge flip, edge split has to create new data structures. Specifically, I create three new edges for the left, top, and right edges in the center. I have the old edge become the bottom of the four center edges. I also create 6 new half edges, two new faces, and one new vertex (the center vertex). All of these are created with the provided functions in the HalfEdgeMesh class, which adds the new data structures to their respective lists.</p>
		<p>Then, like for edge flip, I gather references to all the relevant pre-existing edges, half edges, faces, and vertices. I then update all the necessary pointers for the edges, vertices, faces, and half edges. A bug I ran into was that I forgot to update one of the vertex halfedge pointers. I didn’t notice this bug until implementing loop subdivision in the next part, where after subdividing multiple times, the new positions of a few of the vertices would be way out of place as they thought they were connected to a different edge. To find this bug, and check that there were no other bugs, the GUI’s ability to display the pointers and addresses of each data structure was very helpful. Below are the results after fixing my implementation:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <figcaption>Many edges splits and flips</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>Extra Credit: I implemented support for splitting boundary edges. Unlike regular triangles, the boundary faces are allowed to have more than three half edges, so my implementation doesn’t split the boundary face but instead just adds an extra half edge to it as shown in my diagram below. When trying to implement this, one problem I ran into was that I could not get a reference to the half edge labeled h1 (without looping all the way around the possibly large boundary). This meant that I needed to have the original edge become the top instead of the bottom (as I had it for non-boundary splits). This means I never have to access h1 as it’s next still should point to the same half edge. Other than this change, my implementation was similar to before, and was even a bit simpler since there were less new data structures to worry about.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>For loop subdivision, I followed the recommended steps. First I loop through each vertex in the mesh, and calculate its new position as a weighted sum of its position and the positions of its neighbors. I don’t apply these new positions yet, but store them for the future in the Vertex::newPosition field. Then, I loop through every edge in the mesh, and calculate the position for the soon-to-be-created vertex that will subdivide that edge, again using a weighted sum of the positions of the four neighboring vertices. I store this in the edge::newPosition field.</p>
		<p>Now, I again loop through every edge, performing an edge_split on every edge in the original mesh. To make sure only original edges are split, I will not split an edge if it’s connected to a new vertex (checking the Vertex::isNew field). After the split is done, turning one edge into four, I need a way to remember which edges are actually new and which just lie on an old edge. To avoid having to recalculate which of the four edges lie on the old edge, I simply have the edge_split function set the edge::isNew field properly for all four edges, as it already knows which lie on the old edge. Since edge_split returns the new vertex, I then fill this vertex’s newPosition in with what had been calculated for it in the edge::newPosition field.</p>
		<p>Then, I once again loop through every edge, and perform edge_flip on any NEW edge that is connected to one old vertex and one new vertex. I do this by checking the edge::isNew and the two vertex::isNew fields. Originally, I didn’t realize I wasn’t supposed to flip any old edges, which took awhile to debug before I realized it wasn’t a bug but instead faulty logic.</p>
		<p>Finally, my last step is to loop through all vertices, copying their newPosition field to their actual position. With this, the subdivision is done, and results are shown below.</p>

		<p>Loop subdivision seems to work very well for making meshes smoother. However, one possible problem is that, when used on sharp corners and edges, they are not only smoothed out but also pulled inwards heavily. This poses a problem for meshes that are supposed to have sharp looking edges or meshes where the positions of edges and corners are important (like CAD models). This problem is shown below in the torus, where after subdivision it ends up significantly thinner. However, this can be alleviated by doing many edge splits to add more vertices to the mesh near the old ones so that they aren’t pulled in as far during subdivision. As you can see, this makes the torus better able to retain its original volume.</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		</div>
		<p>Another problem of this loop subdivision method is that meshes that look symmetric can end up asymmetric after subdivision, like the cube shown below. The reason for this is that due to the different possible slants of the diagonals, not all the vertices have the same degree, and since vertices with different degrees use different formulas for their new positions, they will end up being pulled differently by the subdivision. More specifically, the vertices with higher degree will be pulled inwards more. To make the cube subdivide symmetrical, I can first split each diagonal edge so that the cube is actually symmetric and all vertices share the same degree. This leaves the subdivided cube perfectly symmetric, although it ends up looking more like a rounded dice than a sphere.</p>
