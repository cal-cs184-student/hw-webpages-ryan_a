		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>In this homework, I created a cloth simulator that represents the cloth as a grid of masses connected by springs. Using Verlet integration, I can then approximate the physics governing the cloth. I then added collisions with spheres, planes, and with the cloth itself. Finally, I made some basic GLSL shaders for different materials and lighting effects. Overall, I liked the shader part of this assignment the most as I had some prior experience with using shaders in game engines. I was also surprised at how realistic the cloth simulation seemed, with ripples propagating through it like a real cloth.</p>
			
		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<p>To represent the cloth, I construct a 2D array of point masses connected by the three types of springs described below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Structural: connect directly adjacent masses</li>
			<li>Shearing: connect diagonally adjacent masses</li>
			<li>Bending: connect masses two away from each other (only straight, not diagonally)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>One coding problem I encountered was that as I added more point masses to the grid, the vector containing them would resize and in doing so shift its location in memory, making the previous springs pointers to those point masses invalid. I solved this by using vector.reserve() to preallocate enough space so that the vector is never resized.</p>
		<p>The springs are shown below. Note that structural and bending would look the same as they overlap. However, once the cloth starts to bend they will no longer overlap.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>In each simulation step of the cloth sim I first add up the total force on each point mass. This includes both global forces applying to all point masses (like gravity) as well as the force from every spring from hooke’s law. With this calculated, I then apply Verlet integration to calculate the new positions of each point mass. Finally, for the sake of stability I require all springs to be stretched by no more than 10%. If they are beyond this limit, I pull their point masses closer together to bring it to 10%. This completes a basic cloth simulation, although it cannot handle object collisions yet.</p>
		<p>Using different parameters gives different results for the behavior of the cloth. At a low spring constant (< 500 N/m), the cloth falls with very little “stretchiness”, only being constrained by the 10% stretching limit. This results in the cloth falling with little resistance, then stopping suddenly and generating interesting wave patterns the moment the springs start to hit their limits, before finally coming to rest. At a high spring constant, the springs never hit their limits and thus don’t generate the same ripples and the cloth just hangs taught like a trampoline. A comparison is shown below, with images near the start, middle, and once it has come to rest.</p>

		<p>Changing the density of the cloth increases the strength of gravity relative to the springs. Mathematically, increasing density is equivalent to decreasing the spring constant, as the acceleration from the springs is scaled down by the point’s mass (by a=F/m), while gravity is unaffected as it is an acceleration. Thus, an increase in m simply scales down the acceleration from the springs, giving the same results as a decrease in ks. For an extra comparison, below you can see that increasing the density causes the cloth to hang lower as the springs are now weaker against gravity. Also see that at a very high density (1000g/cm^2), interesting patterns emerge as the springs again hit their limits.</p>

		<p>Changing the damping affects how slowly the cloth falls, although ultimately it comes to the same resting position. However, with zero damping the cloth never loses energy and continues to oscillate, leading to interesting results as shown below.</p>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>For sphere collisions, I first check if the point mass’s position is inside the sphere by checking its distance to the sphere’s center. If so, I project the position onto the surface of the sphere. I then correct the position to be equal to the last position plus the correction vector needed to bring it to the projected point. To add some friction, the correction vector is first scaled by (1-friction) so the new position ends up between the projected point and last_position.</p>
		<p>For plane collisions, I check if a collision has occurred by seeing if position and last_position are on opposite sides of the plane. If so, I find where the new position should be if position is projected onto the plane, then pulled a bit further by a small constant to keep it slightly on the side of the plane that last_position was on. Like with spheres, I then update the position to be last_position plus the correction vector needed to bring last_position to the projected point, scaled by (1-friction).</p>
		<p>In my main cloth simulation function, I then apply these collision checks to every point after completing Verlet integration, but before the 10% stretching limit constraint. Here is the cloth laying on the sphere at three different spring constants.</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>For implementing self collisions, I first insert all the point masses up into a hash table based on the 3D box they are in. My hash function does this by subtracting fmod(coordinates) from the point’s coordinates to round it to the nearest box, then hashing that box’s coordinates. This allows for faster self collision testing as a point only has to be tested against others in its box. Thus, for every point, I test it against every other point in its box, and if they are too close (less than the thickness parameter), I shift the original point until they are far enough away. Here are my results for a simulation at default settings:</p>

			<img src="p4/5.png" width="450"/>
		</figure>
		<p>The effects of changing the spring constants are shown below. As you can see, upping the spring constant results in less folds in the cloth (due to the bending springs being stronger). Conversely, decreasing the spring constant gives more folds.</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>As for changing the density, as I described earlier, increasing the density is mathematically equivalent to decreasing the spring constant. I tested this relationship again here and it once again held true. Thus, increasing density gives more folds and decreasing the density gives less folds with the simulations ending up the same as above.</p>
		
			
			
		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>A shader is a program to be run on the GPU. The GPU will run the program simultaneously on many cores, each doing the same operations on different data. The type of data in the input and output buffers is arbitrary, and could be anything in the case of a compute shader.</p>
		<p>As for rendering, a vertex shader operates on vertex data, and thus does per vertex operations such as applying the global transformation matrix to the local vertex positions, or slightly shifting the vertex in the case of displacement mapping. A fragment shader takes in per-pixel data (or really per fragment which is often the same as a pixel), and does per pixel operations, such as calculating lighting and sampling textures. The input data for the pixel shader is interpolated from the vertex shader’s output using the pixel’s barycentric coordinates (hw1). As an aside, there are also other rendering shaders that can be used between the vertex shader and pixel shaders to do things such as tessellation.</p>
		<p>One common pixel shader is Blinn-Phong shading, a lighting effect that combines three types of lighting: ambient lighting applied equally to all points, diffuse lighting based on lambert’s cosine law, and specular lighting that adds specular highlights to locations that are near the right angle to reflect light from the light source to the viewer like a mirror. This tries to approximate real world effects, though it just uses arbitrary equations with arbitrary constants. By varying the constants, one can make different materials appear more specular or more diffuse (matte). My Blinn-Phong shader is shown below, with the different lighting types separated.</p>

		<p>I also made a texture shader, which just samples at the uv coordinates and sets the output color to that sample. (texture png from https://www.colorland.com/us/inspirations/landscape-photography-tips-and-techniques)</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="p5/tex.png" width="450"/>

		<p>Bump and displacement shaders can be used to add fine details to models. Bump mapping does this by modifying the normal in the pixel shader based on the “slope” (really the gradient) of the height map. Thus, by shifting the normal vector it allows lighting to show small details that aren’t actually present in the mesh. Displacement mapping takes this one step further by also shifting the vertex positions based on the height map in the vertex shader. While this allows the height map to physically shift the vertices, it could produce ugly results if the height map has smaller/higher frequency details than the density of vertices in the mesh can show (think aliasing). My bump and displacement shaders are compared below. As you can see, the bricks are physically shifted outwards in the displacement shader, while the bump shader only emulates them with lighting.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

					  <img src="p5/disp.png" width="350px"/>
					  <figcaption>Displacement Mapping</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>As I alluded to earlier, the displacement shader requires a decent vertex density to be able to capture the detail of the height map without aliasing. The two methods are compared at  different mesh resolutions below. As you can see, at the lower vertex density setting displacement mapping basically produces gibberish, but at the higher setting it produces a convincing result. Since bump mapping doesn’t try to move the vertices, it doesn’t care nearly as much about vertex density, and so it looks similar at both settings.</p>

		<p>I also implemented a mirror shader that samples from a cubemap background to show interesting environment reflections. It simply takes the ray between the object and the camera, reflects it across the normal vector, and samples the cubemap in that direction.</p>
